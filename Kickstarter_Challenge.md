# Kickstarting with Excel
**_Fever_ the Play Analysis**
## Overview of Project
This project is analysing the different launch dates and funding goals of the plays in the kickstarter dataset.
### Purpose
Our main goal in this analysis is to help Louise figure out what the best dates and funding goals would be the best for the success of her play *Fever*.
## Analysis and Challenges

I used the dataset given to create a pivot table and a line charts that will allow me to investigate which funding campaigns for theater events were successul, failed or canceled and on what month of the year they were launched. Additionally, I studied the goals of each event and the percentages of the succesful goals based on which range they fall in. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

While I was conducting this analysis I came across some challenges. The main challenge was finishing the COUNTIFS() function on excel without having any bugs in it. After several hours of trial and error as well as a lot of google search I was able to figure it out and complete the challenge. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    The line graph of the theater outcomes based on their launch date gives us a conculsion that the most successful campaigns were the ones launched in the months May and June. Additionally the graph shows that the failed campaigns have a more consistant flow with higher failures during the summer months. This shows that best time to launch a campaign for Louise is in the month of May.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    We can conclude that the most successful campaigns are the ones with a goal up to $15,000 or a goal that falls between $35,000 to $40,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

    I think some of the limitations in this dataset is that it doesn't provide any data about how the final outcomes of those campaigns affected the events and whether the successful funding campaigns produced successful events. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    Anoher possible graph would be the box plot because it can show us the average funding goal for the successful campaigns.
